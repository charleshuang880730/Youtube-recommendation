### **YouTube Highlight Extraction & Recommendation Web App**  

This project is a backend system for extracting highlights and recommending key moments from YouTube videos based on subtitles and user comments. The system integrates natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning techniques to analyze and extract meaningful segments.  

### **Features**
- **Search & Recommendation APIs**: Built with Django and Django REST Framework to provide text-based search and recommendation.  
- **Whoosh Indexing**: Implements Whoosh for efficient text-based search across video subtitles and comments.  
- **Graph Neural Network (GNN)**: Utilizes Word2Vec embeddings and a GNN-based approach to refine recommendations.  
- **RESTful API Integration**: Custom APIs for querying and retrieving highlights from videos.
